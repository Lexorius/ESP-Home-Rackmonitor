Hi, 
this is a small sensor build for the raspberry pi pico w . It is ment to go into some 19" racks to messure the temperatur and all relevant things. 

Features wishlist: 
  - the sensor should integrate into home assistant
  - easy to replicate
  - Temperatur / humidity
  - Door sensor
  - Water leakage sensor
  - maybe external temperature sensor
  - Display optional
